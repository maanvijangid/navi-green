Dynamic Route Optimization and Emission Reduction System üöõüåç
This project is a Python-based application designed to optimize vehicle routes for logistics and transportation while minimizing environmental impact. By leveraging real-time data from various APIs, the system provides efficient, eco-friendly routing solutions to enhance delivery efficiency, reduce costs, and lower carbon emissions.

Features
Dynamic Route Optimization: Calculates the most efficient routes based on real-time traffic, weather, and route data.
Emission Estimation: Estimates CO‚ÇÇ emissions for each route using vehicle details and distance traveled, enabling informed decisions to reduce the carbon footprint.
Interactive Map Visualization: Displays optimized routes and key waypoints on an interactive map using folium.
Traffic and Weather Integration: Considers live traffic conditions and meteorological factors for accurate route recommendations.
APIs Used
TomTom: Provides real-time traffic data and travel time estimates.
AQICN: Supplies weather and air quality information.
OSRM: Generates route geometry, distance, and alternative paths.
Google Maps: Offers geolocation and mapping services.
Technologies and Tools
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
requests for API integration
folium for creating interactive maps
polyline for decoding route geometry
time for handling retries and delays
How It Works
The user provides:

Origin and destination coordinates.
Vehicle details (e.g., fuel efficiency in liters/km).
The system fetches real-time:

Traffic data from TomTom.
Weather and air quality data from AQICN.
Route data from OSRM, including distances and alternatives.
It compares routes based on:

Distance
Traffic conditions
Estimated CO‚ÇÇ emissions
The best routes are visualized on an interactive map with clear markers for starting and ending points.

Use Cases
This system is ideal for logistics companies and transportation providers seeking to:

Dynamically adjust delivery routes for efficiency.
Minimize fuel consumption and carbon emissions.
Provide faster, more reliable services to customers.
Enhance sustainability practices in their operations.
